# UnityURPMetaballParticlesPart1
Part 1 of a series explaining how to make Metaball particles in Unity using URP and Shader Graph. You can read the series [here](https://bronsonzgeb.com/index.php/2021/02/27/particle-metaballs-in-unity-using-urp-and-shader-graph-part-1/)

Credit to [Scratchapixel's series on distance fields](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/advanced-rendering/rendering-distance-fields/basic-sphere-tracer) for the explanation on Metaballs and example code

This is what they'll look like by the end of the series (that'll be in a different repository)
